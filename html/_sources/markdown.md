# Role


**My Role was to Create and And Design the Web-App to Predict the Titanic Survival of the Passenger who boarded the ship.**  
Work flow I Employed:  
--> Collect data and perform ELT|ETL operation on the data so it is more accessible and normalized for the prediction and Analysis  
--> Analyze the dataset and find out the key attribute which contribute to passenger's survival.  
--> Create a Prediction Model Using **LR** to predict the survival of a passenger who satisfy the attributes which are deemed to be crucial.  
--> Do Feature Engineering on the Attribute and perform accuracy test and cross - validate the result.  
--> Use different model Random Forest, CNN to compare the findings to improve upon the model and increase accuracy of the Prediction.
