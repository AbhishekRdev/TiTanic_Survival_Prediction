# TiTanic Survival Project

# 1. INTRODUCTION

The sinking of the Titanic in 1912 remains one of the most infamous disasters in history. The ship, which was considered unsinkable at the time, collided with an iceberg on its first voyage, resulting in the deaths of over 1,500 passengers and crew. While the sinking of the Titanic is a well-known historical event, the factors that contributed to the survival of passengers aboard the ship remain a subject of debate and speculation.
 ## 1.1 Problem Definition
The problem addressed by the Titanic Survival Project is the lack of a comprehensive understanding of the factors that contributed to the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic during its fateful voyage in 1912. Despite decades of research and speculation, there is still much that remains unknown about the dynamics of survival during the disaster. This lack of understanding has implications for disaster preparedness and response in modern times, as emergency managers may be unable to accurately predict who is most at risk during catastrophic events.
 ## 1.2 Problem Overview
The Titanic Survival Project addresses the problem of understanding the factors that contributed to the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic during its fateful voyage in 1912. Despite extensive research and popular media coverage, there remains much that is unknown about the dynamics of survival during the disaster. This lack of understanding has implications for disaster preparedness and response in modern times, as emergency managers may be unable to accurately predict who is most at risk during catastrophic events.

 ## 1.3 Hardware Specification
 
The following hardware specifications could be considered as a starting point for the Titanic Survival Project:  
• CPU: Intel Core i9 or AMD Ryzen Threadripper with at least 12 cores and a clock speed of 3.5 GHz or higher  
• RAM: 64 GB or more  
• Storage: Solid-state drive (SSD) with a minimum of 1 TB storage capacity  
• GPU: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 or equivalent for efficient processing of machine learning models  
• High-speed internet connection for data access and model training  
Additionally, it may be necessary to use cloud-based services or distributed computing systems to handle the computational demands of the project.
